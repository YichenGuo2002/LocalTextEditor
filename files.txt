The Doorway Beyond
The stars shimmered in the vastness of space, but the ship felt like a prison, its metallic walls closing in on Commander Aria Telsis. She sat in the command chair of the Stellar Vanguard, staring at the holographic display of the galaxy. The war with the Dominion had stretched on for decades, and yet, as she scrolled through the reports of the latest skirmishes, something gnawed at her. The enemy’s movements had become too precise, too coordinated. Aria couldn't shake the feeling that someone—or something—was guiding them, pulling the strings from the shadows.//n//nA soft chime echoed through the command deck, snapping her out of her reverie. Lieutenant Zane’s voice crackled over the intercom. “Commander, we’ve detected an anomaly in the outer rim. It’s unlike anything we’ve seen before—no known energy signature, no transponder signal.”//n//nAria's pulse quickened. “Prepare the ship for immediate departure, Zane. I want a full analysis, now.” She stood, making her way to the observation window. The sight of the deep black expanse of space reminded her of the unknown dangers lurking just beyond the horizon. For years, they had fought an enemy they could see, an enemy that followed predictable patterns. But this... this was something different. Something alien.//n//nAs the Stellar Vanguard broke through the outer atmosphere and into deep space, Aria felt a shiver down her spine. The anomaly was a massive, swirling distortion in the fabric of space itself. It pulsed with a strange, hypnotic energy, unlike anything human technology had ever encountered. Aria’s hand hovered over the command panel, her mind racing. The Dominion had always been the enemy they could understand, but this... this was a threat from somewhere far beyond.//n//n"Captain," Zane said, his voice trembling, "this... it’s not just a distortion. It’s a doorway."//n//nAria narrowed her eyes. "A doorway to where?"//n//nZane hesitated before speaking. "I don't know, Commander. But I think it’s opening right now."
